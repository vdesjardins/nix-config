# Intent: Add jujutsu git init aliases

## Prompt
Load the jujutsu-workflow skill and follow its instructions to:
1. Analyze what changes are in the current commit
2. Craft conventional commit message explaining WHY those changes were made
3. Execute `jj describe -m "your message"` to set it on the current commit
4. Do not create INTENTS-*.md file for this command

## Changes Made
Added two new aliases for `jj git init`:
- `gi` - shell expansion abbreviation
- `jgi` - fish shell alias

## Rationale
These aliases improve developer experience by providing quick access to the jujutsu repository initialization command. This supports the workflow documented in the jujutsu-workflow skill, which explains how to initialize jujutsu in existing git repositories. The aliases make it easier and faster to run this common setup command.

## Commit Message Applied
```
chore(jujutsu): add git init aliases for repository initialization
```

The message follows the conventional commits specification and explains that these are tooling/configuration improvements for developer convenience.
