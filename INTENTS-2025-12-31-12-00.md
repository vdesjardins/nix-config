Created miryoku.kbd configuration for Kanata based on Miryoku layout.

Prompt used:
"use kanata https://github.com/jtroo/kanata to build a configuration that replicates the miryoku keyboard layout https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku."

All layers were translated from the Miryoku JSON files into Kanata syntax.
