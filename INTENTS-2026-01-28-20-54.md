# Intent: Update jujutsu module rules for enhanced AI agent workflow

## User Request
Modify the jujutsu home-manager module to generate enhanced rules in the global AGENTS.md file.

The rules should tell AI agents to:
1. Before each task: create a new jj change if working copy has changes
2. After creating the INTENTS file: run `jj describe` following conventional-commits skill
3. Ensure proper change isolation and well-formatted commit messages

## Changes Made
Updated home/modules/modules/shell/tools/jujutsu/default.nix:
- Enhanced the opencode.rules section with detailed workflow instructions
- Added step-by-step guidance for checking and creating new changes
- Added explicit instructions for commit message formatting after INTENTS creation
- Included conventional-commits reference and emoji/type format examples
- Preserved backwards compatibility with existing jj cheat sheet
