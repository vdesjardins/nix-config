### Dashboard JSON Update
**File:** `hosts/modules/linux/shared/grafana/dashboards/opnsense-ids.json`

Removed the "IDS Base Search (do not delete)" panel (panel ID: 20) from the dashboard.

**Command used:**
```bash
jq '.panels |= map(select(.id != 20))' opnsense-ids.json
```

### Verification
- ✅ Panel with ID 20 ("IDS Base Search (do not delete)") removed
- ✅ Panel count reduced: 18 → 17 panels
- ✅ Dashboard UID: `"opnsense-ids"`
- ✅ Dashboard Title: `"OPNsense & IDS/IPS"`
- ✅ JSON is valid and properly formatted

### Remaining Panels
All 17 remaining panels are functional visualization/filter panels:
- Overview row
- OPNsense Logs (stat)
- IDS Events (stat)
- Firewall Connections charts (3 piechart variants)
- Potential Attacks charts (3 piechart variants)
- Firewall/Potential Attacks geomap visualizations (2 geomaps)
- Protocol breakdowns
- Table views
- Detailed row
- Others row

The removed "IDS Base Search" panel was a logs query panel used internally for filtering other panels, but is no longer needed with the current dashboard structure.
